# KPN Assignment

Skills assessment assignment for KPN

### Use Gulp tasks

* `gulp` or `gulp build` to build an optimized version of the application in `/dist`
* `gulp serve` to launch a browser sync server on the source files
* `gulp serve:dist` to launch a server on the optimized application

### Remarks

 - On the assignment description it was specified that a product has
   subscriptions and each subscription has a device price, but if a
   given product is as given an "Apple iPhone 6s 64GB Zilver" wouldn't
   this be an constant value across its subscriptions?
